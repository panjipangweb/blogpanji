## About Me
Hi, I'm Panji Ariyo, a dad of a son and 3 cats, a language enthusiast, and a writer. I love to learn new things in the digital realm and share my knowledge with others.
I'm passionate about learning languages, cultures, and linguistics. I'm also an amateur writer who loves to write about anything that interests me.
I'm a self-taught front-end developer and technical writer. I've published two books and several research papers. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow.
I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you on this blog. I hope you'll join me on my journey of learning and discovery.
